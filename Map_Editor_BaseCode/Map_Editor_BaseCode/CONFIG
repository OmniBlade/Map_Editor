;	Notes:
;	-	Keys are case sensitive!
;	-	Boolean values (yes, no etc.) can be listed the same way the game has: 1, true, yes and 0, false, no.
;	-	All these keys and values are default to Yuri's Revenge, overwrite at own risk.

;	********** Main keys **********
;	The following keys allow you to specify MIX names up to a certain degree.
;	This does not include the MIX files from RA2.MIX and RA2MD.MIX!
;	InstallDir = What is the location of the game files (def: Â¿registry lookup?)?
;	ExpandMix, EcacheMix, ElocalMix = What are the names of the mod MIX files (def: expand, ecache, elocal)? Change if you have changed the mod MIX 
;	names like Mental Omega has (elocal -> emocal, ecache -> emoche).
;	MissionDisk = What is the suffix used for loading certain MIX files (def: md)? Change this if you have edited the suffix like Mental Omega has (md -> mo).
;	InGameLighting = Should everything be rendered with the settings from [Lighting] (def: true)?	; This might weigh heavy on low end machines
;	FA2Mode = Should everything be displayed as in FinalAlert 2 (def: false) Use this if you don't want damaged and shadow frames. Yeah, fuck you Matze
;	NoobMode = Should the Trigger/Tag/TeamType editors be disabled (def: false)? ; Are we really going for this?

;	Some, maybe lots of options should be added for this!

;	********** EXE hacks **********
;	This sections allows you to set whether you are using Ares 
;	Because we're not all retarded, any version NPatch is NOT supported.
;	Unlike with Ares, there's no consideration for NPatch's features such as Palette and new Countries/Sides
;	Additional checks will be done to ensure Ares' DLL and "inj" file exist in the root
