;	Configuration file for the map editor
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;	Notes:
;	-	Keys are case sensitive!
;	-	Boolean values (yes, no etc.) can be listed the same way the game has: 1, true, yes and 0, false, no.
;	-	All these keys and values are default to Yuri's Revenge, overwrite at own risk.

;	********** Main keys **********
;	The following keys allow you to specify MIX names up to a certain degree.
;	This does not include the MIX files from RA2.MIX and RA2MD.MIX!
;	InstallDir = What is the location of the game files (def: Â¿registry lookup?)?
;	ExpandMix, EcacheMix, ElocalMix = What are the names of the mod MIX files (def: expand, ecache, elocal)? Change if you have changed the mod MIX 
;	names like Mental Omega has (elocal -> emocal, ecache -> emoche).
;	MissionDisk = What is the suffix used for loading certain MIX files (def: md)? Change this if you have edited the suffix like Mental Omega has (md -> mo).
;	InGameLighting = Should everything be rendered with the settings from [Lighting] (def: true)?	; This might weigh heavy on low end machines
;	ObeyInGameRules = Should the editor obey rules like "WaterBound", meaning you cannot place a Shipyard on land?
;	FA2Mode = Should everything be displayed as in FinalAlert 2 (def: false) Use this if you don't want damaged and shadow frames.
;	NoobMode = Should the Trigger/Tag/TeamType editors be disabled (def: false)? ; Are we really going for this?

;	Some, maybe lots of options should be added for this!

Eva = evamd.ini
Theme = thememd.ini
AI = aimd.ini
; Singleplayer specific
Battle = battlemd.ini 				; Used solely for "NextScenario" and "AltNextScenario" (and its future Ares extensions). Note: this does NOT point to the gamemode file "mpbattlemd.ini"
; Multiplayer specific
Modes = mpmodesmd.ini
Coop = coopcampmd.ini 		; Note: this does NOT point to the gamemode file "mpcoopmd.ini" 


;	********** Theater keys **********
;	The following sections and keys allow you to specify custom theaters or modified vanilla theaters
;	Defaults are valid for non-vanilla theaters
;	Name = What is the name of this theater, cannot contain spaces (def: Sectionname)? 
;	INIFileName = What is the name of the theater control file (def: NO DEFAULT)?
;	ININame = What is the name the theater has for the key Theater = in [Map] (def: NO DEFAULT)? 
;	NewTheaterSuffix = What is the letter used for the NewTheater key (def: G)?
;	TileExtension = What is the extension name used for loading tiles (def: NO DEFAULT)? Used for loading files like clifx.tem
;	IsoMix = What is the name used on the * for: ISO*.MIX (def: NO DEFAULT)? Used for loading isotemp.mix ;Ehm, shouldn't this be obsolete since the tiles can fly loose in any mix?
;	Mix = What is the name of the MIX where the tiles are located (def: NO DEFAULT)? ;Ehm, same as above?
;	TerrainPalette = What is the full name of the palette used to color the terrain (def: NO DEFAULT)?
;	UnitPalette = What is the full name of the palette used to color SHPs (def: NO DEFAULT)?
;	OverlayPalette = What is the full name of the palette used to color overlay (def: NO DEFAULT)?

;	Each entry has to exist as a separate section!
;	Loads only vanilla theaters if Ares = no ;Nope, currently loads ONLY vanilla theaters
;	WARNING:
;	- As a tribute to Westwood Studios, I made the vanilla theater names hardcoded. This means it will only look for your modified values
;	if they have the name of a vanilla theater. If you modify Lunar to Indoor, keep the name of the theater Lunar
;	After all it's still Lunar, you just changed the assets
;	- Currently ignores [Theaters] since no patch allows custom theaters, only the sections for the theaters themself are read
